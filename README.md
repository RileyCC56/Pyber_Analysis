# Pyber Analysis

### Analysis Overview
The following Pyber analysis was executed to display the differences between three different city types of rural, suburban, and urban and how their total weekly fares for each city type compare to one another. By measuring each city type of total fares calculated per week we are able to display a line chart for Pyber which shows how the first four months of the year match with each other.

### Tools:
MatPlotLib, Pandas, Python

### Pyber Summary

The following display above shows the Pyber city type summary. The Pyber city summary has five different measurables, Total Rides, Total Drivers, Total Fares, Average Fare per Ride, and Average Fare per driver. 

When each city types results are displayed side by side, we see that the popularity for a Pyber ride heavily relies within the Urban cities, followed by Suburban, then Rural. As Urban has the highest number of rides between the three they also lead with the highest total drivers. As Pyber is frequently used within the Urban cities, the Urban cities have the highest fare total. Due to the high frequency of rides and high number of drivers. Urban cities have a lower average fare per ride and average fare per driver compared to the highest leading average which is the Rural area followed by Suburban.


### Analysis Recommendation’s to Pyber

After reviewing the data, we have found that the cost per driver and ride in a Urban setting are low compared to the frequency of trips. As the company’s main profitable source would be within the Urban settings it would be recommended that the cost per trip would increase.

As for the results given within a rural setting it would be recommended that the cost per trip would decrease in order to increase the total rides. Rural settings would have less public transit options compared to the urban setting which causes residents to look for alternative options. If Pyber decreased their cost per ride within the rural settings I believe the customers would frequently request Pyber when needed which could also cause an effect of customer growth.

Comparing the total rides amount to the total amount of drivers between all three city types it would be also recommended to decrease the amount of Pyber drivers. When dividing the total amount of rides by total amount of drivers the average driver has less than 1 ride per driver. Decreasing the amount of drivers could benefit the employee cost for Pyber which could then possibly increase the drivers’ rates.
